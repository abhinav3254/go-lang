                Hello, I'm Abhinav Kumar, a passionate full-stack developer with a knack for building robust and user-friendly applications. I thrive on solving complex problems and leveraging modern technologies to create efficient and scalable solutions.

                I have also scored Internation Rank #1 in Science Olympiad.

                With expertise in Java, Spring MVC, Spring Boot, Node.js, Angular, Android, Flutter, React Native and many more, I specialize in developing seamless front-end and back-end systems. I also have experience with React.js, Flutter, and Vector Embedding Searching with images in MongoDB.

                As a 2023 B.Tech graduate in Computer Science, I continually strive to enhance my knowledge and skills. Beyond coding, I'm intrigued by data structures, algorithms, and exploring new tools like Neo4j and GraphQL.

                When I'm not coding, I enjoy brainstorming innovative tech ideas, collaborating on exciting projects, and staying updated with the latest trends in software development.
                <br />
                Feel free to connect with me to discuss technology, collaboration opportunities, or just to say hi!
